### Question
a) What are the most interesting Javascript constructs we have learned in the past few weeks.
The use of conditional and switch statements. I find these interesting and frustrating because while I understand the logic behind how these work, I still find myself stumbling when being presented with a problem to solve. I've been reading some extra materials and will try writing out the problems to solve and taking items line by line to see if this helps. 

b) What are the most surprising Javascript constructs we have learned in the past few weeks.
I'm interesting in experimenting more with the spread operator. This is not a concept that I have heard before but I can see it being useful. I say this is surprising because in some of my earlier intros to Javascript, I feel many of the same concepts have been introduced like methods, functions and arrays. However, this is the first class where the spread operator was mentioned and illustrated.
